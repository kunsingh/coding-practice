/**
 * ou have d dice, and each die has f faces numbered 1, 2, ..., f.
 *
 * Return the number of possible ways (out of fd total ways) modulo 10^9 + 7 to roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals target.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
 * 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 10: 5+5.
